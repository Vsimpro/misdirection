# Misdirection
Misdirection is a Discord fooling device. 


## How it works?
Misdirection will provide a .gif, .jpg.. any file that will get embedded into discord. Once you visit the site, it will redirect you not to the image, but to a desired destination.



#### **THIS WORKS BEST IF,**
The picture / gif in question prompts the user to middle click. Middle click in discord will automatically open the URL of the embedded media,
unlike when clicking a link you're prompted with "Are you sure you want to visit this site?"

## How to run?
```sh
pip install flask
```

```
python3 main.py
```

Then send discord a link: `domain.xyz/example.gif`
